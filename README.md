## What is it
A set of plugins that can be used inside the NEO core library. Check [here](https://docs.neo.org/docs/en-us/node/cli/setup.html) for the official documentation.

## Using plugins
Plugins can be used to increase functionality, as well as providing policies definitions of the network.

To configure a plugin, do the following:
- Compile from source
    - Clone this repository;
    - Select the plugin you want to enable and type the command `dotnet publish` \(compile it using Release configuration\)
    - Create the Plugins folder in neo-cli / neo-gui (where the binary is run from, like `/neo-cli/bin/Debug/netcoreapp3.0/Plugins`)
 - Copy the .dll and the folder with the configuration files into this Plugin folder.

 Note: you should also paste the dependencies of the plugin to the binary directory of the neo-cli.

The resulting folder structure is going to be like this:

```BASH
./neo-cli.dll
./Plugins/RestServer.dll
./Plugins/RestServer/config.json
```
